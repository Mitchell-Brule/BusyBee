# BusyBee
A website that shows your friends availability based on their schedules.
# Friend Availability Engine

Core logic for computing live availability based on:
- Outlook calendar busy blocks
- Custom recurring activities
- User-defined buffers

Statuses:
- Available
- Busy
- DND (manual override)

This repo contains logic only.
Server, OAuth, and UI are added later.
